<img src="https://github.com/lauraoprisan/lauraoprisan/blob/main/media/donation-app.gif" width="100%" alt="Donation APP"/>

A full stack web application dedicated to donations. The app provides details of the people’s needs throughout Romania so that they can receive help regardless of where they are. The software is designed to have normal users who can select the cases they want to help if they are logged in (or save them for later) and at least one admin who can post, update and delete those cases. The cases can be filtered by tags and location. The cases also have a state which can vary from “needs confirmation” to “solved” or “dropped out”.

## Stage of the project (work in progress)

Functionalities to be implemented next:
- create the status for each case and handle all the stages of the status
- filter cases by region

Regarding UI:
- fix some issues on the modal
- make it fully mobile responsive

## Observations

When creating or updating a post, the admin has to choose from a specific range of images (which are designed to work well together). For this reason, if some other images are added, the outcome can possibly be unexpected. This is a desired feature for this app in order to make the UI look good.

You can download the images here: <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OZC4je_Qfav8OXw27hoc2jfTkIqiyb4w?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Drive Link</a>

To login as the admin use these credentials:
- email: admin-demo@admin-demo.com
- password: Admin123!
